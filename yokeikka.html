              <p>Yökeikka is a customer project made for YLE’s content creator group Pavlovin Rotat. The game serves as a virtual art gallery which showcases the fan art the creators had received.</p>
              <p>It has two different game modes. Peaceful mode allows the player to browse through the paintings at their own pace. The other one is a heist mode where the player is an art thief with the purpose of stealing some of the art pieces in the gallery. They are racing against the time, trying to avoid getting caught by the guards represented by the content creators..</p>
              <p>The idea of the game was born when I was watching the stream from Pavlovin Rotat. They stated that there wasn’t enough time in their streams to present all the fan art they had received, and they mentioned a word “virtual showcase” in their explanation. I immediately started to think if this could be solved with a game. Next day, I wrote an email to the content creators presenting my idea, and after getting a positive reception, the project started. The project lasted approximately 2,5 months starting from the initial pitching email to the launch stream.</p>
              <p>I was <strong>the project lead</strong> and responsible for everything happening inside Unity, from <strong>programming</strong> to <strong>implementing art and audio</strong> alongside <strong>building the environment</strong>. There was a 2D artist helping in creating some graphics and participating in game design. In addition, Pavlovin Rotat was also involved by providing many design ideas, creating in-game audio material, and assisting in testing.</p>
              <p>The game was well received in the community of Pavlovin Rotat. It has now been downloaded 110+ times from Itch.io.</p>

                    <p>The whole design process started from gamification: how to make a possible virtual gallery experience even more engaging to the end users. As the target audience – Pavlovin Rotat and their target audience – were interested in games, adding various game-like elements was beneficial for the design. The content creators suggested some elements themselves, such as adding ranking system for feedback, but I was also responsible for adding some of them, meaning for example timer and narrative behind the heist mode.</p>
                    <p>My biggest accomplishment in the game design of this project was keeping the scope intact. I had many ideas myself, and so did the 2D artist and the content creators. Therefore, it was important to protect the scale of the project by only selecting the most beneficial ideas. Everyone was listened when they came up with improvement ideas, as we all had different kind of expertise to support the design process.</p>
                    <p>I also feel proud of the simple representation of the narrative in the heist mode. Simplistic decisions as using text messages to tell the backstory and instructing the player about mechanics came from me, alongside other minor details.</p>
                    <p>Building the environment was an interesting process. I tried to make sure that there would be enough space for the movement and exploration while also bringing some extra challenges from the walls and statues.</p>
                    <p>The project had many limitations, such as the overall schedule and me being the only developer working inside Unity. This forced the scope of the design to be small. It worked well, as the simple gameplay still had a hook to keep the players engaged.</p>

                  <p>I was responsible for creating all the mechanics in the game. Due to the simple design, the core mechanics are very basic, such as first-person movement.</p>
                  <p>To increase the replayability, there is also lot of randomization. The art is placed randomly on both game modes. During the heist mode, the targeted paintings are randomly selected from different categories. To steal a painting, the player must complete a maze minigame which also generates a random maze each time.</p>
                  <p>Through this project, I was also able to increase my skills especially on audio and video implementations. In addition, I improved in overall code design and event-driven programming.</p>
